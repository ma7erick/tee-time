# How to start CC Tee Times

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can visit the deployment of this app at https://cc-tee-times.herokuapp.com

To run locally, follow these steps:

Clone down the project and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

In your terminal, do `cd server` and then `yarn dev` to start the server.

From the root folder, run `npm start`. This should open a link to localhost:3000 in your browser. And then you should be good to go!
